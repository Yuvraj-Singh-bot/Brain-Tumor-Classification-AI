# üß† Brain Tumor Classification AI

This project uses a deep learning model to classify brain MRI images into four types of brain tumors. It leverages transfer learning with the **VGG16** architecture and deploys the model using **FastAPI** for web access.

##  Model Highlights

- **Model**: Pretrained VGG16 (fine-tuned)
- **Classes**:
  - Glioma Tumor
  - Meningioma Tumor
  - Pituitary Tumor
  - No Tumor
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **Input Size**: 224x224 RGB images
- **Accuracy**: High performance on validation data

## üåê Web Deployment with FastAPI

The model is deployed via a FastAPI backend with a simple HTML frontend. Users can:

- Upload an MRI image
- Get an instant prediction of the tumor type

To run the FastAPI app locally:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
